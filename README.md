# NCAA Report

This project is set up to scrape the NCAA baseball website for game log and career stats for both pitchers and hitters. Everyday game logs are scrapped and then specific players who we may want to follow stats are sent out. There are daily reports, weekly reports and then a YTD report sent out for both pitchers and hitters.
