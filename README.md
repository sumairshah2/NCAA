# NCAA Report

This project is set up to scrape the NCAA baseball website for game log and career stats for both pitchers and hitters. Everyday game logs are scrapped and then specific players who we may want to follow stats are sent out. There are daily reports, weekly reports and then a YTD report sent out for both pitchers and hitters. 


# Daily Report

Daily reports are sent out for both pitchers and hitters nighlty. In our code we are able to choose all the player whose teams had games that night and then report back which played and which did not. This helps the stakeholders see which players had games and may not have played that night. Below is an example of what that looks like. 

Hitters Daily - This also allows us to look at which games are scheduled on any given day.
